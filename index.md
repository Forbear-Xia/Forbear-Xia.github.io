<br>


Here is **Zhenpeng Li (李振鹏)**.<br>  

I am a graduate student in the Department of Mathematics at Bonn University. Prior to Bonn, I have worked on **homotopy theory and number theory** with [Prof. Hana Jia Kong](https://hanajiakong.github.io/), [Prof. Guchuan Li](https://guchuanli.github.io/) and [Prof. Enlin Yang](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/teachers/yangenlin/ely.htm).<br>

If you are interested in any aspect of me, I am always open to discussions and collaborations. Feel free to reach out to me at - 2262644847 [at] qq.com.

## Research Interests


- Algebraic K-theory
- Chromatic Homotopy Theory
- Prismatic Cohomology

My current research focuses on equivariant branches and detailed computations in homotopy theory and number theory. I wish to devote my talent to this meaningful cause and bring a contribution to the academy.
